## About Me
I'm Adam Lugo, a third year Computer Science student at the University of Central Florida, attending for a Bachelor's of Science. My favorite courses so far have been System's Software and Computer Architecture and Design.</br>

I really enjoy low-level programming; my first love was C and my current is C++. I'm currently developing a game engine/library modeled after Godot, but designed to be used directly with C++ as its main 'scripting' language</br>

Outside of school I spend some of my time developing C++ or reading up on it, as well as hitting the gym and going for unnecessarily long walks.</br>

For work I'm an independent tutor; I also do it as a hobby, helping any of my classmates I can. Previously I've spent my time in and out of fast food, with a notable exception of being a parade attendant during the Universal Studios 2024 Christmas Macy's Parade. </br>
