## Text:
I'm Adam Lugo, a third year Computer Science student at the University of Central Florida, attending for a Bachelor's of Science.</br>

I really enjoy low-level programming; my first love was C and my current is C++. I'm developing a game engine/library modeled after Godot designed to be used directly with C++ as its main 'scripting' language.
I'm also working on a AOT compiled systems programming language inspired by C++ with the intention of fixing many of the mistakes it has made over the years. </br>

Outside of school I spend most of my time developing or reading up on development, as well as hitting the gym and going for unnecessarily long walks.</br>

I participate in the Programming for Young Engineers club at UCF, where I volunteer to teach childen the basics of programming using micro:bits.
For work I'm an independent tutor; I also do it as a hobby, helping any of my classmates I can.</br>
